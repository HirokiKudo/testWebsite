                <p>New Zealand-based artist Paul Murray loves nature's random patterns, shapes, textures, 
                    colours and designs – and the infinity of possibilities they provide for the imagination 
                    of both the artist and the appreciator of fine art.</p>
                <p>“I see faces, metaphors and stories and capture them with my camera. Nature speaks to me, 
                    and capturing its magic is a meditative and cathartic process for me,” the artist explains.</p>
                <p>When photographing nature, Paul gets up close and seeks contrasting colours, recurring patterns, harmony, contrast and conflict.</p>
                <p>“I breathe deeply, sharpen my eyes and listen to nature; it guides me. I look for metaphors in the imagery to increase the artistic merit of my works.”</p>
                <p>At his ArtofNature studio, Paul flips, mirrors and inverts the images back onto themselves to create mandala-like montages.
                    The result is infinite imagery: Hidden faces, objects and secrets that depend on a multitude of factors, such as the light, season, 
                    time of day the image was captured, and the randomness of nature itself. Sometimes spooky, sometimes calming, 
                    bright or cheery – the reaction Paul's works inspires will depend on the imagination of the viewer.</p>
                <p>“ArtofNature montages keep on giving; they offer inspiration, tranquility and elicit positive emotions when studied. 
                    My absolute hope is to bring some joy into people's lives through my lens and share my perspective on nature's beauty,” he says. 
                    “I appreciate the art that is all around in nature, the finer detail, a macro perspective. Natural beauty inspires and motivates me. 
                    It is also humbling as it soon becomes evident that we are merely part of nature. With my montages, I seek to be part of the art of nature.”</p>
                <p>Paul's works have been exhibited in Japan, Australia, the United States, Northern Ireland and New Zealand. 
                    He has owned and operated Rongo Gallery in Karamea, New Zealand, since 2004. 
                    The gallery features his own work as well as the work of international artists who participated in its artist-in-residency programme.</p>
                <p>Paul's journey in photography began in Japan where he worked as a photojournalist for the Mainichi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun 
                    from 1994 to 2003. He has held numerous successful exhibitions in Tokyo and his work has been featured in photography and camera magazines, 
                    and newspapers.</p>
